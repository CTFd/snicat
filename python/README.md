# snicat (Python)

We provide a less full featured Python implemention of snicat.

This version of snicat is intended for those who would like to run code that they can easily review or would otherwise prefer Python code over the normal Golang code.

The Python snicat does not have the tunneling feature provided by the main snicat. PRs are welcome to implement this functionality.
